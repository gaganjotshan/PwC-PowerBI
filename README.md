- **Task 1**: Create Call Centre Dashboard - visualizing customer and agent behavior.
- **Task 2**: Create Customer Retention and predict churn customers - visualizing customer demographics and insights.

# Data Sourcing

The Dataset used for this analysis was provided by [Pwc Switzerland](https://www.pwc.ch/en/careers-with-pwc/students/virtual-case-experience.html) and available here: [Call Center Dataset]

# Data Preparation

The dataset was loaded into Microsoft Power BI Desktop for transformation in Power Query and modeling.


### Data Cleaning

Data Cleaning for the dataset was done in Power Query as follows:

- Unnecessary columns were removed
- Each of the columns in the table was validated to have the correct data type
- Unnecessary rows were removed


# Data Modeling

After the dataset was cleaned and transformed, it was ready to be modeled, but the dataset just included one table, so the Data Modeling is nothing much to modify
